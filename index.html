            <h1> LGBT Families in the United States </h1>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The perceived acceptance of the United Statesâ€™ LGBT community increased significantly within the past decade, according to <a href=" http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/13/5-key-findings-about-lgbt-americans/" target="_blank"> Pew Research Center data.</a> However, myths and stereotypes about LGBT parenthood persist.  Homophobic rhetoric often claims that gay couples are not fit to raise children. Meanwhile, the reproductive ability of LGBT people is rarely acknowledged, despite the fact that adoption is not the only means by which same-gender couples can start families. For example, transgender men can experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_pregnancy" target="_blank">healthy pregnancies</a> regardless of how they transition.</p>

            <p>Data from the Pew Research Center and the United States Census Bureau below provides insight on what families headed by LGBT parents look like. </p>
